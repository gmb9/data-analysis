I found this assignment to be more difficult than I had originally expected. I was unable to finish all objectives, and don't really love what I was able to turn out over the time given.

I met with my group once and found that all three of us were a little confused initially. We worked for about 2 hours together and made noticable progress, but unfortunately I was leaving for spring break the following day and we were unable to meet up again to try and iron any persisting problems out.

I did all of my work in my jupyter notebook, and was a little confused as to whether or not we were supposed to do work anywhere other than there. I made graphs comparing instructors/terms to final grades along with pre/post test scores, but was unable to figure out how to compare individual cells to grade each pretest on a student by student basis, thus stopping me from comparing individual student pre/post test grades to their final grade to see if there was any correlation.

To conclude, data analysis was definitely an interesting topic for me, but I had trouble figuring out exactly how to solve every problem given on the homework.
